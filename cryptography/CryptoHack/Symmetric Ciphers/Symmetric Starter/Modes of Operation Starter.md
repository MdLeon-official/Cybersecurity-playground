# Modes of Operation Starter

### STEPS:
1. Go to this website: [Click](https://aes.cryptohack.org/block_cipher_starter/)
2. type `/encrypt_flag/` in url bar: https://aes.cryptohack.org/block_cipher_starter/encrypt_flag/
3. You will see a ciphertext.
4. Paste that ciphertext into `decrypt(ciphertext)`. You will get something like `{"plaintext":"63727970746f7b626c30636b5f633170683372355f3472335f663435375f217d"}` as output.
5. Now copy that plaintext and paste it in `Hex Encoder/Decoder`.
6. You'll get the flag.

#### Flag:
```crypto{bl0ck_c1ph3r5_4r3_f457_!}```
