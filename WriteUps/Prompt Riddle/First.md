## Level 0 - Level 1
Use `hints` and it will give you the password for next level. Then use `password <password>`

## Level 1 - Level 2
Use `resources`.
Theres an image. So use `open file.png`.
Its says **The password is h4cker**. But password cant contain any number so use a instead of 4.
Then used `password <password>`


## Level 2 - Level 3
After using `resources`, I saw there's a text file called readable.txt. So I used `open readable.txt` and saw that the whole content inside that txt file is reversed, but the password isn't. 
Then used `password <password>`
