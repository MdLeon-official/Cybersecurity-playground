#### ðŸ§ª Steps to Solve:

1. Downloaded the `disk.flag.img.gz` file from the challenge.
2. Decompressed it using:

   ```bash
   gzip -d disk.flag.img.gz
   ```
3. Opened **Autopsy** (a digital forensics GUI tool).
4. In Autopsy, followed these steps:

   ```
   New Case â†’ Add Case Name â†’ Next â†’ Add Host â†’ Enter Host Name â†’ Next
   â†’ Add Image File â†’ Browse to decompressed .img file â†’ Next â†’ Finish
   ```
5. In the **ANALYZE** tab, selected **Keyword Search**, searched for `.txt`, and found several text files.
6. Each `.txt` file contained a part of the flag.
7. Combined all pieces to form the complete flag.
